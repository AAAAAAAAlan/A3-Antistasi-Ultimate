Features:

- Playable in SP, MP, and persistent open server MP.
- Blufor vs Greenfor vs Redfor with dynamic battles, let Blufor and Redfor fight and strike them while they're busy, don't draw too much attention or the aggressivity against SDK will increase, causing heavy reactions. Be nice with their wounded instead; If healed they might think to join you!
- Available in both Altis and Tanoa versions.
- AI Enemy Commander which reacts to your movements and manages his resources.
- Around 18 possible Sidemissions: Assasination, Logistics, Destroy Assets, Rescue POWS, Conquer Missions with a wide variety for each type.
- Possibility of Undercovered Operations, same as a Resistance soldier can do.
- Persistent Stat Save System: You won't lose game or server progress upon a game update.

# How to setup

There are 2 islands in the same repository so you have to:

- Copy everything from A3-Antistasi into the A3-AATemplate.Altis folder
- Go into /templates/ inside the A3-AATemplate.Altis folder and deleted the other templates in there
